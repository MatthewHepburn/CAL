----- Cleanup Steps -----
    Amend the usage logs so that the create page has an ID.



----- Assessing test001 -----
    Consider only users with a standard userID (to exclude entries that result from testing)
    Consider only users who have visted at least one question in the inf1 question set.
    Consider only users who have been assigned to a test group.

    For users in each group, determine how many questions in the inf1 question set they answered correctly.

    Use a one tailed t test as our hypothesis is that the group with the progress bar will answer more questions.
    Number of participents was not fixed in advance, used all eligable users in semester 1.

    Results in t-score of 0.26 and p-value of 0.40 â€“ not statistically significant.
