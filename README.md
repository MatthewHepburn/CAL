# FSM Workbench
A web based finite state machine editor created to support Informatics 1: Computation and Logic at the University of Edinburgh.

Instances of the Workbench can be found on [the Informatics Homepages server](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1020995/fsmworkbench/index.html "FSM Workbench") and on [my personal site](https://hepburn.codes/fsm-workbench/index.html "FSM Workbench").
